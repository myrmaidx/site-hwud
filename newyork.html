					<h2>Hudson-Raritan Estuary</h2>
						<p>In truth, the Hudson is not a delta, but an estuary formally known as the Hudson-Raritan Estuary where the Hudson, Hackensack, Passaic, Rahway, and Raritan rivers meet the Atlantic Ocean. 
						<br>	
						An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers flowing into it with a free connection to the open sea.
						<br>
						Thus, to this connection estuaries are subject to marine influences, such as tides and waves, and the riverine influence, such as flows of freshwater and sediment. The mixing of sea and freshwater provides high levels of nutrients, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world, but also makes the water slightly salty, or brackish.
						<br>
						Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments. A transition area where two communities meet and integrate is known as an ecotone and these can be both local or regional.
						<br>
						<br>
						In total there are four different kind of estuaries, each created in a different way:
						<br> 1)	Coastal plain estuaries, or drowned valley estuaries: created when sea levels rise and fill in an existing river valley
						<br> 2)	Tectonic estuaries: when the Earth’s crust shifts together and rifts apart.
						<br> 3)	Bar-built estuaries: when a lagoon or bay is protected from the ocean by a sandbar or barrier island.
						<br> 4)	Fjord estuaries: when glaciers carve out a deep, steep valley.

						<br> The Hudson-Raritan estuary is a coastal plain estuary, more specifically a tidal estuary meaning it ebbs and flows with the ocean tide and supports a biologically rich environment, making it an important ecosystem for aquatic life.

						<br> Estuaries are excellent places for people to settle down and live their lives. They provide water for drinking and hygiene and access to rivers and oceans helps the development of trade and communication. 

						<br> These days pollution accumulates in estuaries. The Hudson is one of the most-trafficked and most-polluted estuaries in the world. Garbage spills into the river. But strict regulations and community activities are working to protect and restore the Hudson-Raritan.
							
						<br>
						<br> <strong> The Hudson </strong> 
						<br> The Hudson River is a 507 km long river that flows from north to south primarily through New York in the United States.
						<br> It originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York where it flows southward through Hudson Valley, to the Upper New York Bay, between New York City and Jersey City, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean at New York Harbor.
						<br> Its watershed covers nearly 13,400 square miles (which is 34,000+ square kilometers). A watershed is the area of land from which water drains into a stream, river, lake, or other water body.
						<br> The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary, a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers flowing into it, and with a connection to the open sea.
						<br> The river is named after the Englishman Henry Hudson, wo explored it back in 1609, but was known as ‘Muhheakunnuk’  to the Mahican people.
						
						<br>
						<br> <strong> The Raritan </strong> 
						<br> The Raritan River is a major river of central New Jersey in the United States. 
						<br> Its watershed drains much of the mountainous area, emptying into the Raritan Bay.
						<br> The river has served and continues to do so as an important water transportation route and in an important source of drinking water for the central portion of New Jersey.

				<h2> New York </h2>
				<p>
<strong> New York itself </strong>
<br>
New York City is the most densely populated city in the United States. It has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, fashion, arts, and sports. New York is an important center for international diplomacy.

<br> As the largest city in the United Stated, New York City has a significant impact on global environmental issues.
It faces environmental challenges such as the impact of city traffic on rising global temperatures, high levels of chemicals in the water, flood management hurdles and methane emissions from food waste.

<br>
<br>
<strong> Environmental Issues </strong>
					
<br> The attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) destroyed several buildings and significantly damaged others, resulting in thousands of tons of particulate matter and debris being released to surrounding environments: including cement, dust, fiberglass, asbestos, and smoke and this effected the Hudson negatively.
<br> The Hudson and Newark Rivers drain major urban areas and are responsible for the majority of the freshwater inputs to the estuary. 
<br> The Hudson–Raritan drainage basin is one of the most urbanized and industrialized areas in the nation; as a result, it is also one of the most polluted estuaries
<br>
<br> Transportation makes up for one-third of New York’s emissions and citizens are encouraged to purchase electric vehicles.
<br> Food waste produces a harmful gas called methane, but food can be composted and be used as a clean energy source.

<br>
<br> 
<strong> Water related issues. </strong>
<br>
Central to the city’s history of cultural and economic development are the complex waterways that comprise New York Harbor and the associated estuarine rivers that surround it. Given the extent of development over a period of four hundred years and exploitation of the harbor’s resource over this time, it is not surprising that its waterways have experienced severe environmental degradation 

<br> Due to its long history of development, New York Harbor is one of the most well researched, monitored, and documented harbors in the world

<br> Millions of New Yorkers are vulnerable to the harmful effect of chemicals and waste in the waters surrounding New York. Sewage discharges led to high bacteria counts and low oxygen levels. Millions of fish were killed, and food webs were contaminated by toxic chemicals.
<br> Dry years, or algal blooms, might leave New York with a water shortage and climate change might worsen the chances of water shortage.
<br> Climate change will severely affect the communities along the coast. Flooding is a major and persistent problem and will only be worse due to sea-level rise and intense storms.

<br>
<br> 
Problems were found in New York’s drinking water, such as
<br> -	Lead, that enters tap water through old lead service pipes and lead-containing plumbing.
<br> -	Chromium 6, a highly toxic metal currently unregulated by the EPA (NYC Department of Environmental Protection). The toxic metal can cause lung, nasal and sinus cancers and other side-effects. The toxic metal can even lead to death.

<br>
<br>
However, significant progress has been made over the last few decades in establishing conservation and restoration plans for the harbor including steps to improve water quality and to improve the overall health of the ecosystem. Consequently, the New York Harbor ecosystem is much healthier than it was 30 years ago.

				<h2> Maps and other charts </h2>
				<p> To show you the location of the Hudson-Raritan estuary and the city New York City the focus lays on there are two maps embedded right underneath this text.
				<br> One is from Google Maps to show its location.
				The other is from ArcGis with multiple layers with a bit more information about the area.
				<br>
				<br> There is also a graph displaying the increase of C02 emissions throughout the years. The rise of C02 leads to a change in the average temperature on earth which leads to climate change and rising sea levels which then leads to bigger problems around New York.
