				Project Deltares Deltas, or just Deltares Deltas, is a project launched by Deltares, a company found in The Netherlands that focuses on delta planning, infrastructure, water and subsurface resources, flood risks, environmental issues, and urban resilience. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In our world a lot of places and countries must deal with the dangers of water and the effects of climate change. Climate change has a huge effect on tons of places, but not every place has the knowledge to defend themselves against the rising water and the extreme weathers that accompany climate change. 
				<br>
				<br> To spread knowledge about delta planning, environmental issues, and flood risks Deltares has decided to share their knowledge with the world, starting with two areas with big worries about the future concerning water issues: New York and Venice.
				<br>
				<br> Officially and technically New York is an estuary and Venice a lagoon and not two river deltas, but as the project expands Deltares will provide information and knowledge on river deltas as well. The project has deliberately chosen to name the project “Deltares Deltas” still.
				
				<br> 
				<br> Hereby is a button to bring you to the delta page of this site and to start your research.
				<br> If your city or area needs help do not be afraid to contact us. (link)
				<br> Our company and our country have enormous experience in fighting water, and we would be delighted to help others out as well.
