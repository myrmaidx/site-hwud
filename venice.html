					<h2> Venetian Lagoon </h2>
						<p>
						Venice lies in the shallow waters of a coastal lagoon connected to the northern tip of the Adriatic Sea, itself a northernly extension of the Mediterranean.

<br>
<br>
A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by reefs, barrier islands, or a barrier peninsula (which are a type of coastal landforms with a dune system that form by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coast). 
<br>
Lagoons are commonly divided into:
<br> -	coastal lagoons 
<br> -	and atoll lagoons. An atoll, or coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef, including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely typically formed around a volcano before the volcano completely subsided beneath the surface of the ocean.

<br>
<br>
The environment in a lagoon is heterogeneous. There is, for example, a land-to-sea salinity gradient and variability of the bottom-floor profile following sediment transport and accretion by wind and/or tide-driven water circulation. 
<br> Diversity in the geomorphology of a lagoon bottom provides diversity in habitats and niches, and these in turn support greater biodiversity. 
<br> Thus, a lagoon’s ecology depends on a delicate dynamic balance between multiple factors, including water circulation and input, sediment transport, geochemistry of sediment particles, and the life history, biology, and ecology of endemic species.

<br>
<br>
The lagoon was formed about six to seven thousands years ago, when the marine transgression following the Ice Age flooded the upper Adriatic coastal plain. Deposition of river sediments compensated for the sinking coastal plain.

<br>
<br>
The Lagoon stretches from the River Sile in the north to the Brenta in the south with a surface area of 550 square kilometers and 8% of it is land, including Venice itself.
<br> 11% is covered by open water or canals while around 80% consists of mud flats, tidal shallows, and salt marshes.
<br> The Lagoon is the largest wetland in the Mediterranean Basin, and it is recognized as a wetland of international importance. 

<br>
<br>
Venice’s lagoon is a complex and delicate environment, a place between terrestrial and aqueous environments, fresh and saltwater systems and its physical form and biology are the results of their interactions.
<br> Thus, today’s look of the lagoon is due to human intervention which had a profound effect on its physical structure and ecology. These man-made changes have inadvertently reduced the lagoon’s resistance to incoming waters.
<br> Today, the lagoon is at risk of becoming a marine bay, due to erosion of sediments and stronger water exchanges with the Adriatic Sea.

				<h2> Venice </h2>
				<p>		
				<strong> Venice itself </strong>
<br>
Venice is a city located in northeastern Italy and is the capital of the Veneto region. 
<br> Its located on a group of 118 small islands separated by canals and linked by over four hundred bridges. They are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay laying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers.

<br>
<br>
The city faces some challenge, including an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by pollution, the city remains a popular tourist destination as well as a major cultural center. It has been ranked quite a few times as the most beautiful city in the world.

<br>
<br>
Since its foundation, the Venetian Republic considered Venice and its lagoon as a single entity, and Venice as the center of a wide and productive commercial and residential system that should be carefully preserved in all its components. Local, regional, national, and international organizations have taken an interest and developed programs to ‘‘save Venice.’’ Thus, the lagoon is a highly complex issue, and the Venice problem is emblematic of our times, representing not just environmental complexity but also legislative, scientific, and institutional intricacy. Meaning Venice is a symbol for unique waterscape, a place in which water and the city have been fused together for centuries.

<br>
<br>
<strong> Environmental issues in and around Venice </strong>
<br>
Sea-level rise, subsidence, erosion, pollution, fishery activity, and wave motion have all contributed to the general crisis of the Venice lagoon system. The ecosystem characteristics have undergone progressive impoverishment and deterioration, with a reduction of the surface area of the salt marshes, deepening of the lagoon beds, and worsening of the water and sediment quality. 
<br> The city of Venice has literally been sinking over the last centuries, with a drop of approximately 23 cm in just the last 100 years. This is primarily the combined result of natural subsidence, accelerated by groundwater pumping for industrial use, and sea-level rise resulting from climate changes. 
<br> The frequency of flooding has increased dramatically, with St. Mark’s Square flooding more than 50 times per year in the 1990s. The problems are clearly evident on a daily basis, as can be attested by anyone who tries to traverse the Piazza San Marco when it is flooded, or anyone living in a building whose lower floor is being eroded by increasing wave action.

<br>
<br>
<strong> …. With a focus on water related issues </strong>
<br> The sinking and flooding causes a lot of issues in and around Venice.
<br> As the water deepens the city is more vulnerable to flooding and associated urban decay. The damaging effects of flooding gradually drive the population away.
Meanwhile vital lagoon habitats have already been lost and those that remain are under threat along with the natural dynamics the city depends on.

<br>
<br>
Maps, surveys, and other historical evidence all show the lagoon is progressively evolving towards a marine landscape. The waters are becoming deeper and marshes and mudflats are disappearing. Erosion is increasing and the water has become as salty as the sea.
<br> Sediment loss has been identified as a key factor in the process of evolution from lagoon to bay. Many lagoon specialists are concerned that with the lack of sufficient sediments and rising water levels, the saltmarshes and mudflats will continue to degrade and possibly disappear within a century. Any sea level rise due to human-induced climate change will exacerbate this trend

<br>
<br> In addition to physical changes to the system, and the effects on saltmarshes and their associated ecosystems, the lagoon was exposed to major pollution since the mid-20th century, with some dramatic consequences for the environment as water quality deteriorated.

<br>
<br>
The main source of the pollution are:
<br> -	 Agricultural run-off: pesticides and fertilizers
<br> -	Industrial waste
<br> -	Urban waste: sewage etc. from Venice and mainland
<br> -	Air pollution: air and road links, industry

<br> 
<br> 
Toxic metals (such as mercury, copper, arsenic and lead) and persistent substances such as organochlorine pesticides and dioxins have accumulated in the lagoon sediment and canals, storing up problems for the future.

<br> 
<br> But out all of these problems, flooding is the most obvious and immediately alarming.
<br> Flooding is occurring increasingly frequently. This is because Venice has sunk. As it is lower in relation to water level, lesser tidal surges can cause flooding – and as the lagoon becomes more like a marine bay it has lost some physical features that used to offer a natural dampening effect on incoming waters, so more water comes into the city with each tide and surge.
